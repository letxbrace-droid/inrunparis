# UX Laws & Principles Reference

Comprehensive catalog of 65+ UX laws organized by 12 categories. For every review, scan every law against every screen/flow. Not every law applies — but every law must be considered.

---

## 1. HEURISTICS & DECISION PRINCIPLES

### Jakob's Law
Users spend most of their time on OTHER apps. They expect your app to work the same way.
- **Audit:** Identify user's top 3 daily apps. Compare layout, interaction patterns, navigation paradigm.
- **Key question:** Does this app match the patterns of apps the user already knows?
- **Common violations:** Custom navigation, non-standard input methods, unfamiliar gesture controls.
- **Mobile-specific:** Check against platform conventions (iOS HIG, Material Design).

### Fitts's Law
Time to acquire a target is a function of the distance to and size of the target.
- **Audit:** Measure primary CTA size (min 44x44pt iOS, 48x48dp Android). Check thumb zone reachability.
- **Key question:** Is the primary action the easiest thing to tap?
- **Common violations:** Small tap targets, primary CTAs far from thumb zone, equal-weight buttons.
- **Low-literacy note:** Larger targets reduce error for users unfamiliar with precise touch.

### Hick's Law (Hick-Hyman Law)
Decision time increases logarithmically with the number and complexity of choices.
- **Audit:** Count choices per screen. Flag any screen with >3 competing actions.
- **Key question:** How many decisions must the user make at each step?
- **Common violations:** Too many nav items, multiple equal-weight CTAs, mode selection gates.
- **Formula:** RT = a + b × log2(n) where n = number of choices.

### Miller's Law
Average person holds 7 (±2) items in working memory.
- **Audit:** Count information units per screen. Verify chunking and grouping.
- **Key question:** How many things must the user remember simultaneously?
- **Common violations:** Long forms without progress, menus with 10+ items, dense screens without chunking.
- **Low-literacy note:** Effective capacity drops significantly. Target 3-4 items max.

### Parkinson's Law
Work expands to fill the time available for its completion.
- **Audit:** Time each flow. Compare to user expectation. Check for progress indicators.
- **Key question:** Does the UI make tasks feel faster than expected?
- **Common violations:** No time estimates, overly complex flows, open-ended processes.

### Occam's Razor
Among competing solutions, the simplest is usually best.
- **Audit:** For each element, ask: what happens if this is removed?
- **Key question:** Can anything be removed without losing function?
- **Common violations:** Feature bloat, unnecessary steps, decorative UI that doesn't aid comprehension.

### Paradox of the Active User
Users never read manuals; they start using software immediately.
- **Audit:** Can a new user complete the core task within 30 seconds of first open?
- **Key question:** Can a first-time user figure this out without instructions?
- **Common violations:** Tutorial-blocking onboarding, instruction text as crutch, tooltips for core features.

### Law of Least Effort (Zipf's Law)
Users will choose the path requiring the least effort.
- **Audit:** Is the most common action also the easiest action?
- **Key question:** Does the UI make the frequent task trivially easy?
- **Common violations:** Burying common actions in menus, requiring multiple taps for frequent operations.

---

## 2. GESTALT PRINCIPLES (Visual Perception)

### Law of Proximity
Objects close together are perceived as related.
- **Audit:** For each label/action, check spatial proximity to its subject.
- **Common violations:** Labels far from fields, actions far from context, mixed groupings.

### Law of Similarity
Elements that look similar are perceived as related.
- **Audit:** Inventory interactive elements. Check visual consistency within types.
- **Common violations:** Buttons that look alike but do different things, inconsistent same-type styling.

### Law of Common Region
Elements within a shared boundary are perceived as a group.
- **Audit:** Map visual containers to functional groups. Flag mismatches.
- **Common violations:** Functional elements split across regions, unrelated items in same container.

### Law of Pragnanz (Simplicity)
People perceive ambiguous images in the simplest form possible.
- **Audit:** Squint test — what do you see first? Is that the most important element?
- **Common violations:** Cluttered layouts, ambiguous hierarchy, competing focal points.

### Law of Uniform Connectedness
Elements visually connected (lines, colors, frames) are perceived as more related.
- **Audit:** Trace visual connections. Verify they match information architecture.
- **Common violations:** Visual connections between unrelated items, missing connections between related items.

### Law of Closure
People fill in missing information to perceive a complete object.
- **Audit:** Check truncated/partial elements for clear continuation signals.
- **Common violations:** Truncated content with no "more" signal, ambiguous affordances.

### Law of Figure-Ground
People perceive objects as either foreground or background.
- **Audit:** Check contrast ratios. Verify interactive elements pop from background.
- **Common violations:** Low contrast between interactive/non-interactive, unclear modal separation.

### Law of Common Fate
Elements moving in the same direction are perceived as related.
- **Audit:** Review animations. Check motion groupings match functional groupings.
- **Common violations:** Unrelated elements animating together, related elements animating separately.

### Law of Continuity
Points connected by straight or smoothly curving lines are perceived as grouped.
- **Audit:** Check if visual flow guides the eye along the intended reading/interaction path.
- **Common violations:** Visual elements that break the natural flow, jarring layout transitions.

---

## 3. COGNITIVE BIASES

### Serial Position Effect
People best remember the first (primacy) and last (recency) items in a series.
- **Audit:** In every list/sequence, check: is the most important item first or last?
- **Common violations:** Key info buried mid-list, filler at start/end of flows.

### Von Restorff Effect (Isolation Effect)
The item that stands out is most likely to be remembered.
- **Audit:** Identify the ONE most important element per screen. Is it visually distinct?
- **Common violations:** Everything emphasized (so nothing is), primary CTA blends in.

### Peak-End Rule
People judge experiences by their peak moment and the end, not the average.
- **Audit:** Map emotional curve. Identify peak and end. Rate each.
- **Common violations:** Frustrating endings, no peak moments of delight.

### Anchoring Bias
First piece of information seen biases subsequent decisions.
- **Audit:** What's the first number/value/option the user sees? Does it set the right anchor?
- **Common violations:** Default values that anchor too high/low, pricing shown in wrong order.

### Selective Attention (Banner Blindness)
People focus on specific stimuli while ignoring others.
- **Audit:** Identify elements resembling patterns users typically ignore (banners, footers, sidebars).
- **Common violations:** Important info in banner positions, critical alerts styled as ads.

### Status Quo Bias
Users resist change and prefer the current state.
- **Audit:** For any change in flow/layout, is there a gradual transition?
- **Common violations:** Radical UI changes without onboarding, removing familiar features without explanation.

### Confirmation Bias
Users see what they expect to see.
- **Audit:** Does the UI match what the user expects based on their mental model?
- **Common violations:** Unexpected content in familiar containers, actions that do something different than expected.

### Framing Effect
How information is presented affects decisions, even with identical data.
- **Audit:** Check how options/features/prices are framed. Positive or negative framing?
- **Common violations:** Negative framing of positive features, unclear benefit statements.

---

## 4. RESPONSE TIME & FEEDBACK

### Doherty Threshold
Productivity soars when response time is <400ms.
- **Audit:** Time every interaction. Flag >400ms without feedback. Flag >2s without progress. Flag >10s without rich feedback.
- **Key question:** Does every interaction respond within 400ms? If not, is there meaningful feedback?
- **Common violations:** No loading indicators, spinners without progress signal, no streaming for AI responses.
- **Thresholds:** 0-100ms = instant. 100-400ms = noticeable but fine. 400ms-1s = needs feedback. 1-10s = needs progress. >10s = needs rich engagement.

### Response Time Limits (Jakob Nielsen)
- **0.1s** — System feels instantaneous
- **1.0s** — User's flow of thought stays uninterrupted
- **10s** — Limit for keeping user's attention
- **Audit:** Categorize every interaction into these buckets. Flag violations.

### Skeleton Screens
Placeholder layouts that show content structure before data loads.
- **Audit:** During loading, does the UI show the shape of what's coming?
- **Common violations:** Blank screens, spinners with no structural preview.

---

## 5. COMPLEXITY & INFORMATION

### Tesler's Law (Conservation of Complexity)
Every system has inherent complexity that cannot be removed — only shifted between user and system.
- **Audit:** For each user decision, ask: could the system make this automatically?
- **Common violations:** Exposing technical decisions to non-technical users, manual config that could be auto-detected.

### Postel's Law (Robustness Principle)
Be liberal in what you accept, conservative in what you send.
- **Audit:** Test with typos, partial input, wrong formats. Does the system help or block?
- **Common violations:** Rigid validation, no autocorrect/suggest, breaking on edge cases.

### Information Foraging Theory
Users will expend effort proportional to the expected value of the information.
- **Audit:** Does each screen clearly signal what value lies ahead? Are "information scent" cues strong?
- **Common violations:** Generic labels, unclear what tapping a link/button will reveal, dead-end screens.

### Progressive Disclosure
Show only essential information first, reveal details on demand.
- **Audit:** Is the initial view simple? Can users drill down for more?
- **Common violations:** All info dumped on one screen, hidden critical features, no layering.

### Cognitive Load Theory (Sweller)
Three types: intrinsic (task complexity), extraneous (poor design), germane (learning).
- **Audit:** Identify and minimize extraneous load. Is the interface adding unnecessary processing?
- **Common violations:** Decorative elements that don't aid comprehension, redundant information, split attention between related elements.

---

## 6. ENGAGEMENT & BEHAVIOR

### Goal Gradient Effect
Motivation increases as one gets closer to a goal.
- **Audit:** Check every multi-step flow for progress visualization.
- **Common violations:** No progress indicators, long flows with no milestones.

### Zeigarnik Effect
People remember uncompleted tasks better than completed ones.
- **Audit:** At flow end, is there a reason for the user to come back?
- **Common violations:** No saved state, conversations that feel "complete" with no follow-up.

### Endowment Effect
People value things more once they feel ownership.
- **Audit:** After 5 sessions, what does the user "own" in this app?
- **Common violations:** No user-generated content, no history, no personalization.

### Variable Reward (Hook Model — Nir Eyal)
Unpredictable rewards drive engagement more than predictable ones.
- **Audit:** Check if content/responses vary between sessions.
- **Three types:** Tribe (social), Hunt (resources/info), Self (mastery/completion).

### Loss Aversion
People prefer avoiding losses to acquiring equivalent gains.
- **Audit:** Check for "you'll lose X" framing. Use ethically.
- **Common violations:** No streak/progress protection, not showing what's at stake.

### Social Proof
People look to others' behavior to guide their own.
- **Audit:** Can users see that others use this successfully?
- **Common violations:** No community signals, no "X people asked this," no ratings.

### Commitment & Consistency
Once people commit to something, they're more likely to follow through.
- **Audit:** Is there a small initial commitment that drives larger engagement?
- **Common violations:** No onboarding investment, no micro-commitments.

### Aesthetic-Usability Effect
Users perceive aesthetically pleasing designs as more usable.
- **Audit:** Screenshot every screen. Rate polish 1-5. Flag anything <3.
- **Common violations:** Placeholder content, inconsistent styling, broken layouts.

### IKEA Effect
People value things more when they've invested labor in creating them.
- **Audit:** Does the app involve the user in creating/customizing something?
- **Common violations:** Fully pre-built experiences with no user investment.

## 7. MOBILE-SPECIFIC PRINCIPLES

### Thumb Zone
Most one-handed usage happens in the natural thumb arc.
- **Audit:** Overlay thumb zone map on screenshots. Flag primary actions outside zone.
- **Zones:** Easy (bottom center), OK (sides/upper-center), Hard (top corners).

### Bottom Navigation Principle
Primary navigation should be at the bottom on mobile.
- **Audit:** Check nav position against platform conventions.
- **Standard:** iOS tab bar (bottom), Android bottom nav (Material).

### Content-First Mobile
Mobile screens should prioritize content over chrome.
- **Audit:** Calculate content-to-chrome ratio. Target >60% content.
- **Common violations:** Oversized headers, persistent toolbars consuming half the screen.

### Touch Target Size
Minimum 44x44pt (Apple HIG) or 48x48dp (Material Design).
- **Audit:** Measure all tap targets. Flag anything under minimum.
- **Low-literacy note:** Increase minimums to 56dp+ for users with less touchscreen precision.

### Offline-First Consideration
In low-connectivity environments, design for offline/degraded states.
- **Audit:** Test on 2G/3G. Check for offline states, cached content, graceful degradation.
- **Common violations:** App completely breaks offline, no cached content, no error states.

### One-Handed Operation
Most mobile usage is one-handed.
- **Audit:** Can all primary actions be completed one-handed? Bottom-first layout?
- **Common violations:** Actions requiring two-handed stretches, top-of-screen critical buttons.

### Interruption Recovery
Mobile users are frequently interrupted.
- **Audit:** What happens when the user switches apps and returns? Is state preserved?
- **Common violations:** Lost input, reset forms, lost scroll position.

---

## 8. ACCESSIBILITY & INCLUSION

### WCAG Contrast Ratios
Text must meet minimum contrast ratios against backgrounds.
- **Standard:** 4.5:1 for normal text, 3:1 for large text (WCAG AA).
- **Audit:** Check all text/background combinations. Flag failures.

### Perceivable Information
Information must not rely on a single sensory channel.
- **Audit:** Is color the only indicator of state? Do icons have labels?
- **Common violations:** Red/green only status, icon-only buttons with no labels.

### Operable Controls
All interactive elements must be usable by all users.
- **Audit:** Can all actions be completed via keyboard/assistive tech? Are touch targets adequate?
- **Common violations:** Custom controls that break accessibility, gesture-only interactions.

### Understandable Content
Content must be readable and predictable.
- **Audit:** Readability level (target 5th grade for general audiences, 3rd grade for low-literacy). Predictable navigation.
- **Common violations:** Jargon, inconsistent navigation, unexpected behavior.
- **Low-literacy note:** Use simple words, short sentences, icons with labels, visual cues over text.

### Error Prevention (Nielsen Heuristic #5)
Design to prevent errors, not just report them.
- **Audit:** Are destructive actions guarded? Do inputs validate in real-time?
- **Common violations:** No confirmation for irreversible actions, post-submission-only validation.

## 9. NIELSEN'S 10 USABILITY HEURISTICS

Quick-reference checklist — apply to every screen:

1. **Visibility of System Status** — Is the user always informed of what's happening?
2. **Match Between System and Real World** — Does the system use the user's language and concepts?
3. **User Control and Freedom** — Can the user undo, redo, and escape easily?
4. **Consistency and Standards** — Do similar elements behave consistently?
5. **Error Prevention** — Does the design prevent errors before they occur?
6. **Recognition Rather Than Recall** — Are options visible rather than requiring memory?
7. **Flexibility and Efficiency of Use** — Are there shortcuts for experienced users?
8. **Aesthetic and Minimalist Design** — Does every element serve a purpose?
9. **Help Users Recognize, Diagnose, and Recover from Errors** — Are error messages clear and actionable?
10. **Help and Documentation** — Is help available when needed, in context?

---

## 10. AI-SPECIFIC PRINCIPLES

### Expectation Setting
Users need to know what the AI can and cannot do.
- **Audit:** Does the interface communicate capabilities and limitations?
- **Common violations:** Overpromising in marketing, no scope indication, no confidence signals.

### Streaming & Progressive Response
AI responses should stream to reduce perceived latency.
- **Audit:** Does text appear token-by-token, or all-at-once after a long wait?
- **Common violations:** "Getting your answer..." spinners for 10+ seconds, no streaming.

### Conversational Turn Length
AI chat responses should match the conversational register of the target user.
- **Audit:** Compare AI response length/complexity to typical messages in the user's reference chat app.
- **Common violations:** Essay responses in chat interfaces, formal language for casual audiences.

### Suggestion Chips / Conversation Hooks
Follow-up prompts drive continued engagement.
- **Audit:** After every AI response, are there clear next actions?
- **Common violations:** Dead-end responses, no follow-up suggestions, user must compose from scratch.

### Graceful AI Failure
When AI doesn't know, it should fail helpfully.
- **Audit:** What happens when AI can't answer? Does it redirect, suggest alternatives?
- **Common violations:** Silent failure, generic "I don't know," no fallback path.

## 11. LOW-LITERACY & EMERGING MARKET DESIGN

*Sources: Medhi et al. (2011) "Designing Mobile Interfaces for Novice and Low-Literacy Users" (ACM TOCHI), GSMA Mobile for Development design guidelines, Indrani Medhi-Thies (Microsoft Research India), Kentaro Toyama "Geek Heresy" (2015)*

### Visual Primacy
Low-literacy users rely on images, icons, and colors as their primary means of navigation and comprehension, rather than text.
- **Key question:** Can a user who cannot read navigate and use this app purely through visual elements?
- **Audit:** Cover all text on each screen: can you still understand what to do? Check that every navigation item has a recognizable, realistic icon. Verify content has supporting imagery (photographs > illustrations > icons).
- **Common violations:** Text-only navigation, abstract icon-only interfaces, reliance on text labels, text-heavy content screens, menus with no visual differentiation.
- **Design principle:** Text should confirm what visuals already communicate, not carry the primary information load. Use photographs of real objects. Use color-coding consistently. Use spatial layout to convey meaning.

### Audio/Voice as Primary Interface
For users who cannot read well, audio (both input and output) should be a first-class interaction mode, not an afterthought.
- **Key question:** Can the user complete the core task flow entirely through voice/audio?
- **Audit:** Map the core task flow: can each step be completed via voice? Check text-to-speech availability. Check voice input quality, error handling, and language support. Verify voice recording UI is discoverable with clear start/stop/cancel states.
- **Common violations:** Voice input as a hidden feature, no text-to-speech for content, voice features require reading instructions to activate.
- **Design principle:** The voice input button should be the MOST prominent interaction element, not a small microphone icon. Provide audio playback for all content. Support the user's local language/dialect.

### Concrete Over Abstract
Low-literacy users understand concrete, real-world representations better than abstract symbols or metaphors. — Medhi et al., 2011
- **Key question:** Are visual elements realistic (photographic) rather than abstract (iconographic)?
- **Audit:** Inventory all icons and images: realistic/photographic or abstract/stylized? Check if metaphors require prior digital literacy (gear = settings, cloud = storage, hamburger = menu). Verify images match the user's local context.
- **Common violations:** Abstract icons for concepts with real-world equivalents, metaphors requiring cultural knowledge, stylized illustrations instead of photographs.
- **Design principle:** Use photographs of real objects matching the user's local context (e.g., local foods, familiar tools, recognizable landmarks). Localize images as well as text. Avoid abstract icons for core functionality.

### Minimal Text, Maximum Meaning
Every word must earn its place. Use the shortest possible text that conveys the full meaning. Support text with visuals.
- **Key question:** Is every text element as short as it can be while remaining clear?
- **Audit:** Check reading level of all UI text (target: grade 3-5). Count words per label/instruction (aim for 1-3 words). Verify every text element has visual support.
- **Common violations:** Long sentences where short phrases suffice, technical vocabulary, complex grammar, paragraph-format instructions, text without visual support.
- **Design principle:** Write for a 3rd-grade reading level in the local language. Use active voice, short sentences. "Take a photo of the problem" not "Please capture an image of the affected item for analysis."

### Guided Linear Flows
Low-literacy users perform better with step-by-step linear flows than with open-ended interfaces requiring wayfinding decisions. — Medhi et al., 2011
- **Key question:** Does the interface guide the user through a clear sequence of steps, or require them to figure out where to go?
- **Audit:** Map the core flow: is it linear (Step 1 → Step 2 → Step 3) or branching? Check for clear "what to do next" signals on every screen. Verify the user never reaches a dead-end.
- **Common violations:** Dashboard/hub screens with multiple equal options, non-linear navigation requiring wayfinding, flows that branch based on user decisions, interfaces that assume the user knows what to do next.
- **Design principle:** The ideal flow: open app → single input → get result → optional follow-up → done. Avoid hub-and-spoke patterns. Make the most common path visually dominant.

### Meaningful Defaults
Pre-select the most common or safest option so the user can proceed with minimal decisions.
- **Key question:** Are intelligent defaults set for every configurable option?
- **Audit:** Check every selection/input: is the most common option pre-selected? Check language auto-detection, location auto-detection, and relevant content based on user history.
- **Common violations:** Empty dropdowns, no pre-selected options, settings with no defaults, language selection with no auto-detection, requiring manual input when the system has the data.
- **Design principle:** Auto-detect everything possible: language, location, time zone, preferences from usage patterns, relevant content. Every decision removed is one less point of confusion.

### Error Tolerance & Forgiveness
The interface should be extraordinarily forgiving of user errors, especially for users unfamiliar with digital interfaces.
- **Key question:** If the user taps the wrong thing or enters wrong information, how quickly and painlessly can they recover?
- **Audit:** Test every possible error path: wrong taps, wrong inputs, back-button, home-button, accidental dismissals. Verify all errors are recoverable in 1-2 taps. Check that no user data is lost on error.
- **Common violations:** Destructive actions without undo, one-way flows with no back option, error states requiring technical knowledge, form data lost on error.
- **Design principle:** Assume the user WILL tap the wrong thing. Design so wrong taps are harmless and reversible. Use confirmation for destructive actions with visual (not text-heavy) dialogs. Auto-save everything.

### Familiar Metaphors from Daily Life
Use interaction patterns from apps the user already knows (WhatsApp, YouTube, phone dialer) rather than novel patterns.
- **Key question:** Would a user whose only apps are WhatsApp, YouTube, and a basic phone dialer understand this interface immediately?
- **Audit:** List the top 3 apps used by the target audience. For each pattern in the reviewed app, check: does it match one of those reference apps? Flag every pattern that requires learning something new.
- **Common violations:** Novel navigation patterns, custom gesture vocabularies, unfamiliar content layouts, interaction models from desktop software.
- **Design principle:** Identify the dominant reference app for the target audience (e.g., WhatsApp for emerging markets, Instagram for younger demographics, Slack for knowledge workers). Those patterns ARE "how apps work" for that audience. For WhatsApp-dominant audiences: bottom input field, send button, voice message via hold-to-record, conversations flow upward, green = connected, blue = read.

## HOW TO USE THIS REFERENCE

**Per-Screen Process:**
1. Run through ALL categories mentally (2-3 minutes per screen once practiced)
2. Flag violations with severity: Critical / High / Medium / Low
3. Tie each violation to the north star metric
4. Propose a fix grounded in the law's principle
5. Compare to reference apps

**Per-Flow Process:**
1. Map emotional curve (Peak-End Rule)
2. Check for open loops (Zeigarnik)
3. Measure time-to-first-value (Doherty + Parkinson's)
4. Verify identity consistency (Jakob's Law at app level)
5. Count decisions per step (cumulative Hick's Law)
6. Assess behavioral mode: is the app training active or passive behavior?

**Low-Literacy Audience Additional Checks:**
1. Cover-the-text test: can you understand the screen without reading? (Tests Visual Primacy)
2. Voice-only test: can the core task be completed entirely by voice? (Tests Audio/Voice)
3. Familiar-app test: does this feel like the user's daily apps (WhatsApp, YouTube, etc.)? (Tests Familiar Metaphors)
4. One-path test: is there exactly one obvious thing to do next? (Tests Guided Linear Flows)
5. Wrong-tap test: what happens if you tap the wrong thing? (Tests Error Tolerance)
