  'project init', 'eagle init', 'bootstrap this project', 'set up this repo for claude',
  'add claude.md', 'onboard this project', 'install eagle skills'. Also trigger when you detect
  a project has no CLAUDE.md and the user is about to do significant work in it.

# Eagle CLAUDE.md

Full project onboarding: generate a minimal project-specific CLAUDE.md, bootstrap LLM Wiki, link Obsidian vault, and install eagle-skills. The CLAUDE.md contains ONLY what is unique to this project — no duplication of global rules.

## Core Constraint

**Before writing any section, check the global `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md`.** If the rule or information already exists there, do NOT include it in the project file. A project CLAUDE.md that restates global rules is bloat, not documentation.

A good project CLAUDE.md for a typical repo is **under 50 lines**. If yours is longer, you're duplicating global concerns.

## What belongs in a project CLAUDE.md

Only these categories. Nothing else.

1. **Project identity** — name, one-line purpose, primary stack
2. **Repo commands** — test, lint, build, dev server, deploy. Only commands specific to THIS repo.
3. **Architecture invariants** — decisions that would surprise a new reader. "API routes are in `src/routes/`, not `src/api/`". "We use Drizzle, not Prisma, despite the Prisma config file being present (legacy)."
4. **Domain vocabulary** — terms that have project-specific meaning. "A 'campaign' is always a marketing campaign, never an ad campaign."
5. **Active constraints** — platform targets, performance budgets, deadlines, compatibility requirements specific to this project.
6. **Project-specific conventions** — naming patterns, file organization rules, or code style that differs from global defaults.

## What does NOT belong

- Deployment workflow (global)
- LLM Wiki rules and page format (global)
- Design system references (global)
- Spectral agent list or usage (global)
- Railway configuration patterns (global)
- Anti-slop rules (global)
- Generic coding best practices
- Anything that applies to ALL your projects

## Process

Follow these steps in order. Each step has a detection check — if already done, skip it.

### Step 1: Analyze the project

Read the project root to understand the stack:

```
- package.json / Cargo.toml / pyproject.toml / Package.swift → stack + commands
- Directory structure (src/, app/, lib/, etc.) → architecture
- Existing CLAUDE.md → sections already written (preserve them)
- .env.example → environment variables the project needs
- README.md → project purpose and setup
```

If there is NO code yet (empty repo or brand-new scaffold), ask the user what they're building and generate a minimal starter CLAUDE.md with just project identity and planned stack.

### Step 2: Check global CLAUDE.md

Read `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md`. Extract all H2 headings. These are the topics you MUST NOT duplicate. If a project concern overlaps with a global section, reference it don't restate it.

### Step 3: Bootstrap LLM Wiki directories

**Detection:** Check if `raw/` and `wiki/` directories exist.

If missing, create the full structure:

```
raw/                          # Immutable source documents
wiki/
  index.md                    # Master index of all wiki pages
  log.md                      # Change log for wiki operations
  summaries/                  # Source document summaries
  concepts/                   # Concept pages
  entities/                   # Entity pages
  syntheses/                  # Cross-source synthesis pages
```

Write starter `wiki/index.md`:

```markdown
---
title: "Wiki Index"
type: index
created: <today>
updated: <today>
---

# <Project Name> Wiki

Knowledge base for <project-name>. Pages are organized by type:

- **Summaries** — key points from source documents in `raw/`
- **Concepts** — definitions, patterns, and techniques
- **Entities** — people, tools, services, and systems
- **Syntheses** — cross-cutting analysis and comparisons

## Pages

_No pages yet. Use `ingest raw/<file>` to create summaries from source documents._
```

Write starter `wiki/log.md`:

```markdown
---
title: "Wiki Log"
type: log
created: <today>
updated: <today>
---

# Wiki Change Log

| Date | Action | Page | Notes |
|------|--------|------|-------|
| <today> | init | — | Wiki structure created by eagle-claude-md |
```

### Step 4: Obsidian vault integration

**Detection:** Check if the symlink already exists in the vault.

The vault is the observer — the symlink lives IN the vault, pointing TO the project's wiki directory. This keeps the git repo clean (no vault-specific paths committed).

1. **Find the vault.** Check in order:
   - Read `~/.claude/eagle-config.json` for a saved `vaultPath`
   - Probe `~/eaglevault/`
   - Probe `~/Documents/Eagle Vault/`
   - Probe `~/Obsidian/Eagle Vault/`
   - If not found, ask the user for their vault path

2. **Save the vault path** to `~/.claude/eagle-config.json` so future runs don't re-prompt:
   ```json
   { "obsidianVaultPath": "/Users/<user>/eaglevault" }
   ```

3. **Create the symlink:**
   ```bash
   mkdir -p "<vault-path>/projects"
   ln -sfn "<absolute-project-path>/wiki" "<vault-path>/projects/<project-name>"
   ```

4. **Verify** the symlink resolves: `ls "<vault-path>/projects/<project-name>/index.md"`

If Obsidian is not installed (`/Applications/Obsidian.app` missing), skip this step and note it in the output. Don't install Obsidian — just inform the user.

### Step 5: Generate project CLAUDE.md

**If CLAUDE.md exists:** Read it, identify sections by H2 heading, merge — only add sections that are missing. Never overwrite existing sections. Leave user-written content untouched.

**If CLAUDE.md does not exist:** Generate a new one.

Structure:

```markdown
## <Project Name>

<one-line purpose>

## Stack

<primary tech: language, framework, database, hosting>

## Commands

| Command | What it does |
|---------|-------------|
| `<test>` | Run tests |
| `<lint>` | Run linter |
| `<build>` | Build for production |
| `<dev>` | Start dev server |

## Architecture

<2-5 bullet points about non-obvious structural decisions>

## Conventions

<only if there are project-specific patterns worth noting>
```

The output should feel like something a senior engineer writes in 5 minutes when handing off a repo — not a generated document.

### Step 6: Install eagle-skills

**Detection:** Check if eagle-skills are already installed:
- Skills: `ls ~/.claude/skills/eagle-*/SKILL.md 2>/dev/null | wc -l`
- Agents: `ls ~/.claude/agents/eagle-*.md 2>/dev/null | wc -l`

Expected: 11 skills, 12 agents.

**If missing or incomplete:**

1. Check if the repo is already cloned:
   ```bash
   ls ~/.eagle-skills/.git 2>/dev/null
   ```

2. If not cloned, clone it:
   ```bash
   git clone --quiet https://github.com/eagleisbatman/eagle-skills.git ~/.eagle-skills
   ```

3. If already cloned, pull latest:
   ```bash
   git -C ~/.eagle-skills pull --quiet
   ```

4. Symlink all skills (directories):
   ```bash
   mkdir -p ~/.claude/skills
   for skill in ~/.eagle-skills/eagle-*/; do
     name=$(basename "$skill")
     [ -f "$skill/SKILL.md" ] || continue
     ln -sfn "$skill" ~/.claude/skills/"$name"
   done
   ```

5. Symlink all agents (.md files):
   ```bash
   mkdir -p ~/.claude/agents
   for agent in ~/.eagle-skills/agents/eagle-*.md; do
     ln -sfn "$agent" ~/.claude/agents/$(basename "$agent")
   done
   ```

6. Verify counts match expected (11 skills, 12 agents).

**If already fully installed:** Skip and report counts.

### Step 7: Report

After all steps, print a short summary:

```
eagle-claude-md complete:
  CLAUDE.md:     <created | updated | already up to date>
  LLM Wiki:      <created | already exists>
  Obsidian:      <linked to <vault>/projects/<name> | skipped (no vault) | already linked>
  Eagle Skills:  <11/11 skills, 12/12 agents | installed | already installed>
```

## Idempotency

This skill is safe to run multiple times. Each step checks its own state before acting:

- Wiki dirs exist → skip creation
- Symlink exists and points correctly → skip linking
- CLAUDE.md section exists → skip that section
- Vault path saved → skip prompting
- Eagle-skills fully installed (11 skills + 12 agents) → skip installation

Re-running after project changes should only add new sections to CLAUDE.md if the project has evolved.
